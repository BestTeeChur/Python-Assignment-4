## Daily Lesson Plans

### Monday

#### Date of Assignment: **Monday**

#### Instructions for Students
1. **Introduction to Functions**  
   - Read the [Python Functions Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions).
   - Discuss the purpose of functions in programming.
   - Teacher demonstrates a simple function in Python.

2. **GitHub Setup**  
   - Ensure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
   - Go to the provided public repo URL and **fork** the repository to your own account ([How to Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)).
   - **Clone** your fork to your local machine ([Cloning Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).

3. **First Python Function**  
   - In your cloned repo, create a file named `first_function.py`.
   - Write a function called `greet()` that prints `"Hello, World!"`.
   - Commit your changes and **push** to your repo ([How to Commit and Push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)).

#### Homework
- Read about function arguments: [Python Function Arguments](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions_arguments.asp).
- Write a function named `greet_name(name)` that prints `"Hello, <name>!"` in your repo.

#### Materials Needed
- Computer with Python and Git installed
- GitHub account
- URL of the class public repo

---

### Tuesday

#### Date of Assignment: **Tuesday**

#### Instructions for Students
1. **Review Homework**
   - Share and discuss solutions for `greet_name(name)`.

2. **Function Parameters and Return Values**
   - Teacher explains parameters and `return` values in functions.
   - Modify `greet_name` to return the greeting string instead of printing it.

3. **Collaboration on GitHub**
   - Create a new branch in your fork called `add-functions` ([Branching Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/creating-branches)).
   - Write a function `add(a, b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.
   - Commit and push the changes to your branch.

#### Homework
- Write another function in your branch called `subtract(a, b)` that returns the difference.
- Prepare a short (3-4 sentences) explanation of when to use the `return` statement.

#### Materials Needed
- Access to yesterday’s files
- GitHub repo (forked and cloned)
- Internet connection

### Wednesday

#### Date of Assignment: **Wednesday**

#### Instructions for Students
1. **Peer Review via Pull Requests**
   - Read: [About Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
   - Open a **pull request** to submit your `add-functions` branch changes to the main branch of your fork.
   - Pair up with another student to review each other's code on GitHub ([Reviewing PRs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests)).
   - Leave at least one comment or suggestion.

2. **Function Scope**
   - Teacher introduces the concept of variable scope within functions.

#### Homework
- Write a function `multiply(a, b)` in your branch.

#### Materials Needed
- Access to GitHub and your fork
- Peer partner assigned by teacher

#### Instructions for Students
1. **Merge Pull Requests**
   - Teacher reviews how to **merge** pull requests ([Merging PRs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request)).
   - Merge your pull request after peer review is complete.

2. **Refactoring and Code Organization**
   - Move all your functions into a new file called `math_functions.py`.
   - Add a docstring to each function ([Python Docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)).

3. **Testing Functions**
   - Teacher introduces basic testing by writing a few test calls in a `test_math_functions.py` file.

#### Homework
- Write a function `divide(a, b)` that returns the result of division.
- Update your test file to test all four functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide.

#### Materials Needed
- GitHub and your fork
- Python interpreter

### Friday

#### Date of Assignment: **Friday**

#### Instructions for Students
