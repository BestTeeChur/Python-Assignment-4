# Python-Assignment-4
Function work with the Magic 8-ball. 


For this assignment you'll need to fork this repo and add your group as collaborators. Remember, when adding collaborators they have push and pull privileges for the repo, but they can't commit to main so everyone will need to be making branches and PRs in order to collaborate. 

Each student in a group should have at least 1 commit to the project. LAck of visible commits to the project (or commits that change very little) will be grounds for variations in grade between group members. 

The goal is to take this code and make it work. It is full of errors and one function is completely blank. You must ensure that the program can run completely as intended by fixing the errors and completing the last function `play_again`.
